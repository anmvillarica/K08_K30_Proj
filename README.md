## Description: 
This webpage will have a simple in-browser game that will take the player on a journey in which the player must complete/type simple codes with missing elements that will allow them to progress on their journey. 

## Game Proper:
Each game level will have its own webpage. Every level will have ten codes that must be completed before a player can progress to the next level. It will be a simple side scrolling game that has a fantasy-adventure setting. A player’s end goal will be to locate a key and unlock the exit to progress.

> ## Application of JS
>JavaScript will be used for the in-browser game. It will be found in the game proper and will be used to move sprites, detect correct and incorrect inputs from players, and allow the player to progress to the next level upon completing one.
